## [Bite 37. Rewrite a for loop using recursion](https://codechalleng.es/bites/37/)

<p>In this beginner Bite we let you rewrite a simple countdown for loop using <i>recursion</i>. See <code>countdown_for</code> below, it produces the following output:</p><pre>$ python countdown.py
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
time is up
</pre><p>You will be tested on having the same output, making it work with another start value, and of course if you used recursion. Have fun!</p>
